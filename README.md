# weather-dashboard

This projected tasked us to create a weather dashboard so that a user can enter the name of a city and see the current weather and the weather for the next five days.

This projected tasked us to use the OpenWeather API to fetch the necessary information to display to the user. In addition, once a city has been displayed a button is to appear to keep track of all the cities the user searched for. The user should then be able to click on each button that appeared and see the weather for the corresponding city
